### .NET Framework中用到的设计模式



[design-patterns-used-in-the-net-framework ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1064440/design-patterns-used-in-the-net-framework)

#### 1. 装饰器模式

>   - System.IO.Stream
>   - System.IO.BufferedStream
>   - System.IO.FileStream
>   - System.IO.MemoryStream
>   - System.Net.Sockets.NetworkStream
>   - System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoStream
> The subclasses decorate Stream because they inherit from it, and they also contain an instance of Stream that is set up in the constructor.



#### 2. 迭代器模式
> An obvious one is the Iterator pattern. using the Enumerator class in the framework:
>Iterators in the .NET Framework are called "enumerators" and represented by the IEnumerator interface. IEnumerator provides a MoveNext() method, which advances to the next element and indicates whether the end of the collection has been reached; a Current property, to obtain the value of the element currently being pointed at; and an optional Reset() method, to rewind the enumerator back to its initial position. The enumerator initially points to a special value before the first element, so a call to MoveNext() is required to begin iterating.


#### 3. 抽象工厂模式

> ADO.Net is all about Abstract Factory for getting rid of the details of connecting to data sources


#### 4. 订阅者模式

> Events are an implementation of the Observer pattern


#### 5. 适配器模式

> Adapter Pattern in the DataAdapter used with various data sources such as OleDB, Sql, and Oracle.
